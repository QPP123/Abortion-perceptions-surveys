Analysis of Changes in Social Perceptions on Abortion

## Overview

We investigate changes in the social perception of abortion in the United States over the past five decades, utilizing data from the General Social Survey. We analyze 46,700 survey responses and find that opinions on abortion have slightly shifted over time. Support for abortion depends on aspects as the health of the woman, economic constraints, marital status, fetal health issues, and there was rape. A specific example from the results is that support for abortion for women who donâ€™t want children for any reason increased from 37.7% in 1977 to 58.9% in 2022. This study highlights the critical role of social perception in shaping abortion-related legislation, healthcare access, and the broader discourse on gender equality and women's autonomy.
