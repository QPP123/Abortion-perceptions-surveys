Investigating-Social-Perceptions-of-Women-s-Rights-and-Abortion-Over-Years-A-Research-with-Surveys

## Overview

This paper analyzed 46,700 survey responses; this paper finds that perceptions of abortion have changed slightly over time. Our analysis draws on the decades-old U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) dataset "Perceptions of Abortion in U.S. Society." It is programmed in R. This study highlights the critical role of societal perceptions in shaping abortion-related legislation, healthcare delivery, and the broader discourse on gender equality and women's autonomy.
