The error you're encountering when trying to render your Quarto document is likely due to a typo or syntax issue in the YAML header of your .qmd file. Let's go through the header you provided and correct any errors:

Typo in "subtitle": You have subitle instead of subtitle.
Quotation Marks for thanks Field: The value for thanks should be enclosed in quotation marks, and it should align correctly as a key-value pair.
Typo in "bibliography": You have bligrapgy instead of bibliography.
Multiline Key Error: This error suggests that there is an issue with how the keys are structured or a missing colon or improper indentation.
Here is a revised version of your YAML header with corrections:


Make sure to replace [ADD SPECIFIC RESULT - SUPPORT FOR ABORTION HAS INCREASED FROM 10% in 1972 to 35% in 2022.] with the actual text or remove it if it's not needed. Also, ensure that the file references.bib exists in the correct directory relative to your Quarto document. Once these corrections are made, try rendering the document again.

The error message indicates that readxl::read_excel() is being used to open a file that is not in Excel format (.xls or .xlsx). However, in your code, you are specifying a .csv file path and attempting to open it with read_excel(), which is designed exclusively for Excel files.

To fix this error, you should use the appropriate function to read a CSV file. In R, you can use read_csv() from the readr package to read CSV files. Here's how you can correct your code:

r
Copy code
#| include: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# download the packages if necessary, then load the packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(readr)  # Ensure readr is loaded for read_csv

file_path <- here("inputs", "data", "analysis_data", "analysis_data.csv")
data <- read_csv(file_path)  # Use read_csv to read a CSV file
In this corrected code, read_csv(file_path) is used instead of readxl::read_excel(file_path) to read the CSV file correctly. This should resolve the error and allow your Quarto document to render without halting execution.
